# Lisflood code

Source code of lisflood model.

To compile this Cython module to enable OpenMP multithreading (parallel kinematic wave):

1) Delete the files *.so (if any) in directory hydrological-modules  

2) Inside the hydrological_modules folder, execute "python2 compile_kinematic_wave_parallel_tools.py build_ext --inplace"  

Important: the module has to be compiled on the machine where the model is run - the resulting binary is not portable.  

Then in the settings file the option "numberParallelThreadsKinematicWave" may take the following values:  
    - "0"           : auto-detection of the machine/node's number of CPUs (all CPUs are used minus 1) (do not set it if other simulations are running on the same machine/node)  
    - "1"           : serial execution (not parallel)  
    - "2", "3", ... : manual setting of the number of parallel threads.  
                      (if exceeding the number of CPUs, the option is set to "0") -->  
```xml
<textvar name="numCPUs_parallelKinematicWave" value="30"/>
```
